# Rules when developing code

- When you create a new file, always write testcase for it if it is in these folders: /src/contexts, /src/hooks, /src/lib, /src/models, /src/pages, /src/providers, /src/utils
- When you edit the existing file, always run ```npm run test``` to validate that your new code doesn't break current logic. If you broke it, try to fix it until it passes.
- After finished editing code and all test passes, always run ```npm run lint:fix``` to do some eslint fix.
- Always look at problems in console, and fix it immediately.
