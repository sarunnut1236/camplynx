# Rules when developing code

- When you create a new file, always write testcase for it if it is in these folders: /src/contexts, /src/hooks, /src/lib, /src/models, /src/pages, /src/providers, /src/utils
- When you edit the existing file, always run ```npm run test``` to validate that your new code doesn't break current logic. If you broke it, try to fix it until it passes.
- After finished editing code and all test passes, always run ```npm run lint:fix``` to do some eslint fix.
- Always look at problems in console, and fix it immediately.

# Folder organization purpose
- components -> contain UI dumb components, e.g. ChadCN UI components, Custom component
- Contexts -> react custom contexts
- hooks -> react custom hooks
- lib -> some knid of library
- models -> schema for data, e.g. interface, types, dtos
- pages -> page which renders UI and responsible for logic in the page
- providers -> handle data-related logic. and linked with api services or backend
- utils -> utilities classes
